# ABSTRACT
Predictive maintenance is an important application of machine learning and artificial intelligence that aims to prevent unexpected equipment failures by predicting maintenance needs.
To ensure the trustworthiness of these predictive maintenance systems, it is imperative to provide transparent and understandable explana- tions for their predictions.
This paper explores the development of a counterfactual explanation method for predictive maintenance systems, building upon the Machine Learning Misprediction Di- agnoser (MMD) approach proposed by Cito et al [LINK](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3510457.3513081).
The MMD method, originally designed for explainability in the context of machine learning models of code, is adapted and extended to be more useful and relevant for Predictive Maintenance (PdM).
Our research evaluates the effectiveness and applicability of the mod- ified MMD method and provides insights into how it improves the interpretability of predictive maintenance predictions, thereby enabling more informed maintenance decisions.
